# CLI commands

For installed command help, run `tinytouch COMMAND --help`.

## Global options

```text
tinytouch [--verbose] COMMAND
tinytouch --version
tinytouch --help
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |
| `--verbose` | Print subprocess, serial, and device-response diagnostics |
| `--version` | Print the installed CLI version and exit |

Global options must precede the command:

```sh
tinytouch --verbose status
```

Most commands accept `--port PATH`. Without it, the CLI finds or prompts for a device.

## `setup`

```text
tinytouch setup [--mode {hid,piv}] [--port PATH] [--skip-enroll] [--no-pair]
```

Checks the device, enrolls a fingerprint, and configures PIV or HID.

`--skip-enroll` keeps current templates. `--no-pair` applies only to PIV and leaves the identity unpaired on macOS.

## `mode`

```text
tinytouch mode {hid,piv} [--port PATH]
```

Changes mode after fingerprint approval. Reconnect the device when prompted.

## `led`

```text
tinytouch led {on,off,only-auth} [--port PATH]
```

`on` enables the sensor ring. `off` disables it, including authentication feedback.
`only-auth` disables idle blue and keeps red/green authentication feedback
(CLI and firmware 0.1.30+).

## `status`

```text
tinytouch status [--port PATH]
```

Prints JSON containing:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `protocol` | Host/device protocol; the current CLI requires `6` |
| `firmware` | Firmware semantic version |
| `build` | First 12 characters of the source commit, or `development` |
| `mode` | `piv` or `hid` |
| `piv` | `ready` or `unconfigured` |
| `piv_pin` | Fallback PIN: `unset`, `set`, or `blocked` after five wrong entries (firmware 0.1.32+) |
| `led` | Saved sensor LED setting: `on`/`off` (0.1.29+) or `only-auth` (0.1.30+) |
| `led_only_auth` | `1` when authentication-only lighting is supported (firmware 0.1.30+) |
| `sensor` | `ready` or `offline` after a live UART probe |
| `fingerprints` | Raw template count, retained for compatibility; use `tinytouch fingers` for finger blocks |
| `finger_groups` | `1` when whole-finger commands are supported (firmware 0.1.29+) |
| `hosts` | Number of registered HID computers |
| `ota` | `idle`, `writing`, or `staged` |

## `test`

```text
tinytouch test [--port PATH]
```

Checks serial communication and device status.

## `logs`

```text
tinytouch logs [--port PATH]
```

Prints up to 32 recent touch and HID events.

## `enroll`

```text
tinytouch enroll FINGER [--replace] [--port PATH]
```

Enrolls finger `1` through `10` through the complete four-view sequence. Use the
same finger for every view and lift it when prompted. Each view is scanned twice.

```sh
tinytouch enroll 1
tinytouch enroll 2
tinytouch enroll 3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101
```

## `fingers`

```text
tinytouch fingers [--port PATH]
```

Lists occupied and partially occupied finger blocks and space for additional
fingers. With existing templates 1–5, fingers 1 and 2 are occupied and eight blocks
remain available. No changes or fingerprint authorization are needed to list them.

## `delete`

```text
tinytouch delete FINGER [--port PATH]
```

Deletes the **entire** block for finger `1` through `10` after fingerprint approval.
For example, `tinytouch delete 2` deletes templates 5–8, including any legacy print
in that block. It does not delete other fingers. To delete all state, use
`factory-reset`.

See [Device configuration](/reference/configuration#fingers-and-existing-enrollment)
for the complete mapping and interrupted-enrollment behavior.

## `computers`

```text
tinytouch computers [list] [--port PATH]
tinytouch computers remove HOST_ID [--port PATH]
```

Lists or removes up to eight HID hosts. Removing the final host selects PIV mode. To add a host, run HID setup on that Mac.

## `keys`

```text
tinytouch keys [--port PATH]
```

Creates a PIV identity after fingerprint approval.

## `pair`

```text
tinytouch pair [--port PATH]
```

Pairs the PIV identity with the current macOS user. Requires administrator and fingerprint approval.

## `pin`

```text
tinytouch pin {set,clear} [--port PATH]
```

Sets or clears a fallback PIN for PIV login when nobody can touch the sensor,
such as over Screen Sharing or RustDesk (CLI and firmware 0.1.32+). Enter it
where macOS asks for the smart-card PIN. Each change requires fingerprint approval.

The PIN is 6 to 8 letters, digits, or ASCII symbols, and cannot be `111111`.
It approves the same single login a fingerprint does. Five wrong entries disable
it until the next fingerprint touch.

The fallback PIN replaces the fingerprint, so anyone who knows it can log in
while tinyTouch is connected. Do not reuse your Mac password.

## `update`

```text
tinytouch update [--port PATH]
```

Updates the CLI, HID helper, and firmware. Reconnect the device after staging.

## `factory-reset`

```text
tinytouch factory-reset [--port PATH]
```

Removes fingerprints, keys, hosts, settings, local HID credentials, and PIV pairing. Requires confirmation and a fingerprint.

## `rom` / `bootloader`

```text
tinytouch rom [--port PATH]
tinytouch bootloader [--port PATH]
```

Prints ROM-mode instructions. Flash with the [Flash center](/flash) or ESP-IDF.

## `config`

```text
tinytouch config NAME [VALUE] [--port PATH]
```

Without a value, prints status. With a value, writes a protected setting:

| Name | Range | Default | Effect |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `typing_delay_ms` | 1–100 | 7 | Delay after HID key press and release |
| `submit_enter` | 0 or 1 | 1 | Type Enter after the HID password |
| `touch_cooldown_ms` | 100–5000 | 800 | Minimum interval between touch actions |

`STATUS` doesn't return these values. A successful write can still report a verification error.
